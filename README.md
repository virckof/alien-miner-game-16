# Alien Miner - Android Physics-based 2D Platformer (2015-16)

The main actor of the game is an adventurous alien whose primary mission is to collect precious gems while exploring the galaxy. In this version of Alien Miner the main actor of the game is found inside a cave with hidden treasures and dangerous meteorites. The goal of the game is to guide the alien through the cave while collecting all its precious treasures. The alien should avoid the meteorites at all cost.

For every emerald and diamond collected, the player will receive 20 and 30 points respectively. While emeralds are collected when the alien touches them, diamonds are collected when the player taps on their screen position. If the alien gets hit by a meteorite, the player will lose 20 points. The game has a total duration of 120 seconds. However, if the player reaches the teleportation portal at the need of the level, the game will come to an end.
